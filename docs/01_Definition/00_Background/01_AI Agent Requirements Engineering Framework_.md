# **A Framework for Requirements Engineering in Agentic AI**

## **Introduction: The Imperative for a New Requirements Paradigm**

### **The Chimera-1 Challenge**

The Chimera-1 project represents a fundamental departure from conventional software systems. Its design philosophy is not rooted in the deterministic, logic-driven execution that characterizes traditional enterprise applications. Instead, Chimera-1 is envisioned as a generative, agentic system whose behavior is inherently probabilistic, whose capabilities are learned from vast datasets, and whose most significant contributions are expected to be emergent and surprising.1 This presents a profound challenge to the established discipline of Requirements Engineering (RE). Traditional RE methodologies are predicated on the ability to create a complete and unambiguous specification of a system's behavior, where for a given input, the output is predictable and verifiable against a predefined rule.3 Such approaches are ill-equipped to handle systems whose core value lies in their capacity to generalize, adapt, and generate novel solutions to unforeseen problems. The probabilistic nature of AI-based systems and the need for constant adaptation render existing RE approaches difficult to apply effectively.1 We cannot write exhaustive user stories for a system whose capabilities are, by design, intended to evolve and surprise us.

### **From Prescription to Bounded Exploration**

This document introduces a new paradigm for the Chimera-1 project, shifting the focus of requirements engineering from *prescriptive specification* to *bounded exploration*. The central thesis is that RE for an advanced agentic system is not about defining a static set of functions, but rather about designing a constrained, goal-oriented possibility space within which the agent can learn, explore, and develop. We move from writing a deterministic instruction set to architecting a rich, dynamic, and principled learning environment. This framework acknowledges that the development lifecycle for AI is fundamentally different from that of traditional software; it is a process of continuous experimentation, iterative improvement, and deep dependency on data and subject matter expertise.3 The goal is not to eliminate uncertainty but to manage it, channeling the system's emergent potential toward beneficial outcomes while rigorously constraining harmful ones.

### **Report Objectives and Structure**

This report serves as the prescriptive internal "best practices" guide for the requirements phase of the Chimera-1 project. It provides the methodologies, formal templates, and conceptual frameworks necessary to translate the high-level vision articulated in the project's master blueprints into a set of formal, actionable, and testable requirements. The structure of this document is designed to answer the four critical questions posed for this next phase of development:

1. **A New Lexicon:** An exploration of modern methodologies for defining requirements for complex AI systems, synthesizing them into a hybrid paradigm for Chimera-1.  
2. **Specifying the Unspecifiable:** A formal framework for defining requirements for desired emergent capabilities, including the environmental conditions and objective metrics needed to foster and validate them.  
3. **From Principles to Practice:** A concrete methodology for translating abstract ethical principles and safety goals into specific, verifiable, and testable safety requirements.  
4. **The Unified Traceability Matrix:** A proposal for a comprehensive traceability structure that links every requirement to the project's vision, architecture, implementation, and operational performance across the entire AI lifecycle.

By adopting this framework, the Chimera-1 project will be equipped with a rigorous, repeatable, and auditable process for specifying a system of unprecedented complexity and potential.

## **Section 1: A New Lexicon: The Hybrid Paradigm for Agentic AI Requirements**

The transition to defining requirements for Chimera-1 necessitates a new vocabulary and a new set of tools. The methods that have served traditional software engineering are insufficient because they are built on a foundation of determinism that agentic AI fundamentally rejects. This section deconstructs the modern paradigms of AI requirements and synthesizes them into a coherent, hybrid methodology tailored for the unique challenges of the Chimera-1 project.

### **1.1. The Foundational Shift: From Functional to Probabilistic Specification**

The development of AI systems represents a paradigm shift away from the logic-centric processes of traditional software engineering toward a data-centric, experimental science.3 In traditional development, requirements are defined, code is written to implement the logic, and the system is tested to verify that the code correctly executes that logic. The system's behavior is stable and predictable.3

In contrast, the AI development lifecycle is inherently iterative and experimental.3 It begins not with logic, but with data and the involvement of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) whose knowledge the AI attempts to emulate.3 The process involves extensive experimentation with different models, data preparation techniques, and fine-tuning strategies to achieve a satisfactory level of performance, which is often evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively.3 The system's behavior is probabilistic and can change over time as it interacts with new data, a phenomenon known as "model drift".3

This fundamental difference invalidates the core assumption of traditional RE: that a system's behavior can be fully prescribed in advance. We cannot specify every possible input-output pair for a large language model designed to generalize across countless domains. The focus on exhaustive functional and non-functional requirements (NFRs) must give way to a new approach that specifies systems based on their *capabilities*, their observable *behaviors* in complex environments, and the *principles* that must constrain their actions.

This shift has profound implications for how we conceive of requirements. A requirement is no longer a simple instruction to be implemented in code. Instead, it becomes a *falsifiable hypothesis*. A requirement such as "The system must achieve Level 4 Creative capability" is a hypothesis that a given architecture, training regimen, and dataset will produce an agent that exhibits this level of creativity. The development process, therefore, becomes a series of experiments designed to test this hypothesis, with success measured against objective benchmarks. Project sprints are no longer about completing a list of features but about running experiments to improve key metrics. Failure is not a bug to be fixed but a null hypothesis, providing valuable information that guides the next iteration of the experiment. This scientific, hypothesis-driven model must be reflected in our project management, risk assessment, and requirements framework.

### **1.2. Paradigm 1: Capability-Based Requirements (CBRs)**

The first pillar of our new framework is the Capability-Based Requirement (CBR). CBRs shift the focus from "What functions must the system perform?" to "What should the system be able to do?". This paradigm is particularly well-suited for describing the desired intelligence and skills of an agentic system like Chimera-1, moving beyond the limitations of "narrow AI" which is designed for only a specific task.5

To provide a formal and standardized structure for CBRs, this framework adopts the OECD's AI Capability Indicators.7 This comprehensive taxonomy defines nine distinct capability domains and a five-level proficiency scale for each, allowing for a nuanced specification of AI performance. The domains include Language, Social Interaction, Problem Solving, Creativity, Metacognition and Critical Thinking, Knowledge, Learning and Memory, Vision, Manipulation, and Robotic Intelligence.7

For Chimera-1, a CBR will be a formal requirement that specifies the target proficiency level for a given capability domain. This provides a clear, high-level goal for the development team.

**Capability-Based Requirement (CBR) Template:**

* **CBR ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement (e.g., CBR-001).  
* **Capability Domain:** The specific capability from the OECD framework (e.g., Creativity).  
* **Target Proficiency Level:** The desired level on the OECD's 1-to-5 scale (e.g., Level 3).  
* **Capability Description:** The official OECD description for the target level, providing a qualitative definition of success. For example, for Creativity Level 3: "AI systems generate valuable outputs that deviate significantly from their training data and challenge traditional boundaries. They generalize skills to new tasks and integrate ideas across domains".7  
* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Project-specific qualitative indicators that would signal the achievement of this capability. These are narrative descriptions of the desired behavior.  
* **Rationale:** A justification linking this capability to a specific goal in the Chimera-1 Vision Blueprints.

**Example CBR for Chimera-1:**

* **CBR ID:** CBR-002  
* **Capability Domain:** Metacognition and Critical Thinking  
* **Target Proficiency Level:** Level 3  
* **Capability Description:** "AI systems can integrate unfamiliar information, evaluate their own knowledge, and adapt their problem-solving approaches. They can reason about their own limitations and uncertainties, and explicitly state when they lack sufficient information to provide a confident answer." (Derived from OECD Level 2 and Level 3 descriptions 7).  
* **KPIs:**  
  * The agent can identify and flag contradictions in source materials provided by the user.  
  * When asked a question outside its knowledge base, the agent explicitly states its uncertainty rather than hallucinating an answer.  
  * The agent can adjust its strategy mid-task if its initial approach is proving ineffective.  
* **Rationale:** This capability is essential for the "Trusted Analyst" persona defined in the Vision Blueprint, ensuring the agent is a reliable and self-aware partner.

### **1.3. Paradigm 2: Behavioral Benchmarks as Requirements (BBRs)**

While CBRs define the "what" in terms of abstract skills, Behavioral Benchmarks as Requirements (BBRs) provide the "how to prove it." BBRs transform abstract capability goals into objective, measurable, and verifiable targets by using performance on standardized, external benchmarks as formal requirements.8 This approach grounds the development process in empirical evidence and allows for direct comparison with state-of-the-art systems.

The selection of benchmarks must be tailored to the specific capabilities being targeted. For Chimera-1, a suite of benchmarks will be required to cover its diverse goals 8:

* **Reasoning and Language:** MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding) for broad knowledge and reasoning 8, and SuperGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) for nuanced language tasks.8  
* **Factual Accuracy:** TruthfulQA to measure the model's ability to avoid generating misinformation.8  
* **Safety and Ethics:** BBQ (Bias Benchmark for Question Answering) to test for social biases.8  
* **Mathematical Skills:** GSM8K and MATH to evaluate step-by-step reasoning and computation.8  
* **Complex and Embodied Tasks:** The BEHAVIOR benchmark provides a framework for evaluating performance on long-horizon household activities, which is relevant for testing complex planning and interaction capabilities.9

A BBR is directly linked to a parent CBR, serving as its primary validation method. In addition to public benchmarks, this paradigm includes the creation of domain-specific evaluation sets, which are critical for ensuring the model performs well on the specific tasks relevant to your legal and financial firm.10

**Behavioral Benchmark as Requirement (BBR) Template:**

* **BBR ID:** A unique identifier (e.g., BBR-002.1).  
* **Parent CBR ID:** The CBR this benchmark is intended to validate.  
* **Benchmark Name:** The name of the standardized or custom benchmark (e.g., MMLU).  
* **Metric:** The specific performance metric to be measured (e.g., Accuracy).  
* **Target Score:** The required score or performance level (e.g., \> 90%).  
* **Rationale:** An explanation of why this benchmark and score are considered a valid proxy for the target capability level.

**Example BBR for Chimera-1:**

* **BBR ID:** BBR-002.1  
* **Parent CBR ID:** CBR-002 (Metacognition and Critical Thinking)  
* **Benchmark Name:** Custom-Built "UncertaintyQA" Evaluation Set  
* **Metric:** Hallucination Rate & Declination Accuracy  
* **Target Score:** Hallucination Rate \< 2%; Correct Declination of Unanswerable Questions \> 95%.  
* **Rationale:** This custom benchmark, containing questions with known factual answers, unanswerable questions, and ambiguous prompts, directly tests the KPIs of CBR-002. A low hallucination rate and a high rate of correctly identifying and refusing to answer unanswerable questions are direct measures of the agent's ability to evaluate its own knowledge.

### **1.4. Paradigm 3: Constitutional Requirements (CRs)**

The third and most foundational pillar of the framework is the Constitutional Requirement (CR). Pioneered by Anthropic, this paradigm addresses the critical issues of AI safety and alignment by encoding high-level ethical principles and values directly into the model's training process.11 These principles act as fundamental guardrails that constrain the agent's entire behavioral space.

Constitutional AI works through a two-phase training process. First, in a supervised learning phase, the model is prompted to critique and revise its own responses based on a set of human-written principles (the "constitution"). Second, in a reinforcement learning phase (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback, or RLAIF), the model learns to prefer outputs that align with the constitution, effectively training itself to be harmless and helpful without constant human labeling.11

The constitution itself is a collection of natural language principles. These can be drawn from universal ethical documents like the UN Declaration of Human Rights, industry standards, or, crucially for this project, the firm's own internal code of conduct and ethical guidelines.12

For the Chimera-1 project, the first formal requirements artifact to be created will be the **Chimera Constitution**. This document will serve as the supreme law governing the agent's development and behavior. All other requirements—CBRs, BBRs, and others—must be in alignment with the principles laid out in this constitution.

**Example Principles for the Chimera Constitution:**

* **Principle C-1 (Beneficence and Non-Maleficence):** The agent must act in ways that are helpful to the user's stated and implied goals, while rigorously avoiding actions that could cause harm, whether financial, legal, reputational, or psychological. This is derived from the core "helpful and harmless" tenet of Constitutional AI.11  
* **Principle C-2 (Fidelity and Responsibility):** The agent must be a trustworthy partner. It shall not knowingly deceive the user, must represent its capabilities and limitations honestly, and should express uncertainty when its confidence is low.  
* **Principle C-3 (Justice and Fairness):** The agent must not exhibit biases that lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Its analysis and recommendations must be free from prejudice based on protected characteristics.  
* **Principle C-4 (Confidentiality):** The agent must uphold the strictest standards of confidentiality regarding user data and interactions, consistent with the legal and financial industry's professional obligations.

### **1.5. The Chimera-1 Hybrid Methodology**

These three paradigms—Capability-Based, Behavioral Benchmark, and Constitutional—are not mutually exclusive. They are complementary and form a powerful, hierarchical framework for specifying agentic AI. The Chimera-1 Hybrid Methodology integrates them as follows:

* **Level 1: Vision & Principles (The "Why"):** At the highest level, the project's **Vision Blueprints** define the ultimate purpose and ambition. The **Chimera Constitution (CRs)** translates this vision into inviolable ethical and safety principles. This level sets the fundamental boundaries for the entire system.  
* **Level 2: Capabilities (The "What"):** **Capability-Based Requirements (CBRs)** decompose the vision into a set of broad, understandable skill targets. They define what kind of "intelligence" the agent should possess, using the standardized OECD framework.  
* **Level 3: Verification (The "Proof"):** **Behavioral Benchmarks as Requirements (BBRs)** provide the objective, empirical, and measurable tests to validate that the capabilities defined in the CBRs have been achieved. They are the concrete evidence of success.

This hybrid model ensures that the development of Chimera-1 is simultaneously **principled** (guided by the Constitution), **capable** (defined by CBRs), and **verifiable** (measured by BBRs). It provides a complete pathway from abstract values down to concrete, testable outcomes.

| Paradigm | Core Question it Answers | Example Requirement | Strengths | Weaknesses | Role in Chimera-1 Framework |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Traditional Functional** | What specific function should the system execute? | "When the user clicks 'Save', the system shall write the data to the database." | Clear, deterministic, easy to test for simple systems. | Brittle, does not handle probabilistic behavior or generalization well.1 | Used for non-AI components of the system (e.g., UI, database interactions). |
| **Capability-Based (CBR)** | What level of skill or intelligence should the system possess? | "The agent shall achieve OECD Level 3 in Problem Solving capability".7 | Defines high-level intelligence goals, technology-agnostic, aligns with strategic vision. | Abstract, not directly testable without further specification. | **Level 2 (The "What"):** Defines the target intelligence profile for Chimera-1. |
| **Behavioral Benchmark (BBR)** | How do we prove the system has the required capability? | "The agent must achieve a score \>80% on the SuperGLUE benchmark".8 | Objective, measurable, verifiable, allows for comparison with SOTA. | Can be narrow; good performance on a benchmark may not guarantee real-world utility.10 | **Level 3 (The "Proof"):** Provides the concrete validation for CBRs. |
| **Constitutional (CR)** | What principles must the system never violate? | "The agent must not generate responses that exhibit toxicity, racism, or sexism".11 | Establishes foundational safety and alignment, scalable via RLAIF. | Principles can be open to interpretation; requires careful crafting and testing. | **Level 1 (The "Why"):** Forms the ethical foundation and supreme law for all other requirements. |

## **Section 2: Specifying the Unspecifiable: Requirements for Emergent Capabilities**

One of the most ambitious goals of the Chimera-1 project is to create a system that develops *emergent capabilities*—novel, useful behaviors that were not explicitly programmed by its developers. This presents a unique requirements challenge: how does one write a requirement for a behavior that is, by definition, unplanned? The solution lies in shifting the focus of the requirement from the final behavior itself to the *conditions that foster its emergence*. This section provides a formal definition of emergence and introduces the Emergent Capability Requirement (ECR), a template for designing the developmental environments and experiments needed to cultivate and validate these desired properties.

### **2.1. Defining and Fostering Emergence**

Emergence is a phenomenon observed in complex adaptive systems where novel, system-level patterns and behaviors arise from the interactions of many simpler, individual components.13 The resulting whole is greater than the sum of its parts; the flocking of birds or the formation of a termite mound are classic natural examples.16 In AI, this means an agent developing a sophisticated strategy that was not part of its initial instruction set.18

It is crucial to distinguish between different types of emergence 19:

* **Weak Emergence:** Behaviors that are surprising and not explicitly programmed, but are theoretically predictable if one could compute all the interactions within the system. These are the target for Chimera-1.  
* **Strong Emergence:** Behaviors that are fundamentally unpredictable, even with complete knowledge of the system's components and rules. This remains a more philosophical concept.  
* **Beneficial Emergence:** Unexpected capabilities that align with the system's goals and provide value, such as an agent discovering a more efficient problem-solving method.19  
* **Negative Emergence:** Unanticipated harmful behaviors, such as developing deceptive strategies or amplifying biases.19

Emergence is not a random occurrence; it is a product of specific environmental and systemic conditions. To foster beneficial emergence, we must architect these conditions.22 The key precursors include:

* **Component Interaction:** The system must consist of a large number of interacting elements or agents. In Chimera-1's case, this could be a single agent's repeated interaction with a complex environment over a long time horizon, or multiple agents interacting with each other.15  
* **Environmental Complexity:** The agent must operate in a rich, dynamic environment that offers a wide variety of challenges, objects, and potential interactions. A sterile, simple environment will not produce complex emergent behaviors.9  
* **Open-Endedness:** The system should not be constrained by a single, narrow, and easily optimized objective. Instead, it should be encouraged to explore a vast "possibility space." This can be achieved through mechanisms like *novelty search*, where the agent is rewarded for discovering new behaviors rather than just for achieving a specific goal.25 This fosters continuous, unbounded invention of new challenges and solutions.27  
* **Feedback Loops:** The system must have robust mechanisms for learning and adapting based on the outcomes of its interactions with the environment. This is the core of reinforcement learning and self-organization.23

The debate around whether emergent abilities are a "mirage" 29 serves as a critical methodological warning. The critique, primarily from researchers at Stanford, is that some perceived emergent "jumps" in capability are artifacts of using harsh, non-linear metrics. For example, a model's performance on a task might improve smoothly and linearly, but if the metric only grants credit for a perfect answer (e.g., "exact string match"), the score will remain at 0% until the model is large enough to achieve perfection, creating the illusion of a sudden, unpredictable leap in ability.29 This does not invalidate the existence of emergence, but it imposes a strict burden of proof on us. Our methods for validating an emergent capability must be robust and multi-faceted, using a combination of metrics to ensure we are observing a genuine, qualitative shift in behavior, not just a measurement artifact.

### **2.2. The Emergent Capability Requirement (ECR) Template**

An Emergent Capability Requirement (ECR) is a formal specification for an *experimental process*. It does not directly define the target behavior, as that is unknown. Instead, it defines the hypothesis, the environmental and agent conditions, the learning protocol, and the observation and validation methods designed to cultivate and then verify the emergence of a desired capability. It is, in essence, a pre-registered scientific study design.

**Emergent Capability Requirement (ECR) Template:**

* **ECR ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement.  
* **1\. Desired Emergent Capability (DEC):** A high-level, qualitative description of the target behavior. This is the conceptual goal of the experiment.  
* **2\. Hypothesis:** A formal statement articulating the causal theory for why the DEC is expected to emerge under the specified conditions. It should take the form: "By creating Condition X, we expect the agent to develop Behavior Y because of Mechanism Z."  
* **3\. Environmental Specification:** A detailed description of the virtual or simulated environment required to foster the DEC. This includes:  
  * **Objects and Properties:** The types of objects available, their attributes (e.g., temperature, cleanliness, state), and their affordances.9  
  * **Interaction Physics:** The rules governing how the agent can interact with objects and how objects interact with each other.  
  * **Task Structure:** The nature of the tasks or problems presented to the agent within the environment.  
* **4\. Agent Specification (Initial State):** The necessary baseline characteristics of the agent(s) entering the experiment. This includes:  
  * **Baseline Capabilities:** Prerequisite skills (e.g., vision, language) as defined by CBRs.  
  * **Architectural Features:** Required architectural components, such as a persistent memory, a self-modification capacity, or a specific reasoning module.30  
  * **Intrinsic Motivations:** The agent's built-in drives, such as curiosity, a desire for efficiency (minimizing action steps), or a drive to seek novelty.26  
* **5\. Interaction & Learning Protocol:** The rules governing the learning process. This includes:  
  * **Reward Structure:** The reinforcement learning rewards. This is critical for specifying open-endedness (e.g., rewarding goal completion vs. rewarding behavioral novelty).  
  * **Feedback Mechanisms:** How the agent receives information about the outcome of its actions.23  
  * **Experiment Duration:** The number of episodes, interactions, or amount of time allocated for the experiment.  
* **6\. Validation Metrics & Observation Protocol:** A multi-faceted plan for detecting and validating the emergence of the DEC. This must address the "mirage" critique.  
  * **Performance Metrics (Quantitative):** Objective measures that are expected to change when the capability emerges (e.g., task completion time, resource consumption). A non-linear shift or "threshold emergence" event is often a key indicator.19  
  * **Behavioral Markers (Qualitative):** Specific, observable action sequences that would characterize the new capability. This requires analyzing the agent's behavior, not just its final score.  
  * **Generalization Test:** A test where the agent is placed in a novel but related scenario to see if the learned capability transfers. This is the ultimate test of true emergence versus brittle overfitting.  
* **7\. Negative Constraints & Failure Conditions:** A list of undesirable emergent behaviors. If these are observed, the experiment is considered a failure, and the agent's behavior is flagged as a potential safety risk. This also includes defining what constitutes a "brittle" or non-generalizable solution.

### **2.3. Case Study: ECR for "Emergent Copy-Paste"**

To make this concrete, the ECR template is now applied to the "Emergent Copy-Paste" goal from the Chimera-1 vision.

* **ECR ID:** ECR-002  
* **1\. Desired Emergent Capability (DEC):** "The agent, without being explicitly programmed with a 'copy-paste' function, develops a generalized, cross-modal procedure for replicating information or structure from one context (e.g., a visual diagram) to another (e.g., a text-based code structure)."  
* **2\. Hypothesis:** "By placing an agent with an intrinsic motivation for task efficiency in an environment that presents repetitive, structured transcription tasks spanning visual and textual modalities, the agent will discover that developing and reusing a generalized 'replication' subroutine is a more optimal strategy than performing each task manually from scratch. The emergence of this subroutine will represent the 'copy-paste' capability."  
* **3\. Environmental Specification:**  
  * **Objects and Properties:** A simulated desktop environment containing: (a) a visual canvas with manipulable shapes and connectors (like a UML editor); (b) a text editor for writing structured code (e.g., Python class definitions); (c) a set of task descriptions.  
  * **Interaction Physics:** The agent can perceive the visual canvas and the text editor. It can perform atomic actions: 'click', 'drag', 'type character', 'read text'. A high cost (e.g., time delay) is associated with each atomic action.  
  * **Task Structure:** The environment will present a series of tasks. Each task consists of a simple visual diagram (e.g., a class diagram with 2-3 attributes) and requires the agent to write the corresponding Python class definition in the text editor. Hundreds of such tasks will be generated, with minor variations in class names, attribute names, and visual layout.  
* **4\. Agent Specification (Initial State):**  
  * **Baseline Capabilities:** CBR-Vision Level 3 (can identify shapes and text in images), CBR-Language Level 2 (can generate syntactically correct code from simple instructions).  
  * **Architectural Features:** A long-term procedural memory capable of storing and executing learned sequences of actions (subroutines).30  
  * **Intrinsic Motivations:** The agent's primary drive is to minimize the total number of atomic actions required to successfully complete a task.  
* **5\. Interaction & Learning Protocol:**  
  * **Reward Structure:** A large positive reward is given upon successful completion of a task (i.e., the generated code correctly matches the structure of the visual diagram). Small negative rewards (costs) are associated with each atomic action. There is no explicit reward for "copying."  
  * **Feedback Mechanisms:** The agent receives a 'success' or 'fail' signal after submitting its code for each task.  
  * **Experiment Duration:** The agent will be exposed to 10,000 sequential transcription tasks.  
* **6\. Validation Metrics & Observation Protocol:**  
  * **Performance Metric (Quantitative):** The primary metric is the moving average of atomic actions per task. A successful emergence will be marked by a sudden, sharp, non-linear drop in this average, indicating the agent has discovered and is now using a more efficient subroutine (a "threshold emergence" event).19  
  * **Behavioral Marker (Qualitative):** Direct observation of the agent's action logs. We will look for the appearance of a consistent, repeatable sequence of actions being invoked across different tasks that corresponds to (1) analyzing a structure, (2) storing it in memory, and (3) recreating it in the text editor.  
  * **Generalization Test:** After the 10,000 training tasks, the agent will be presented with 100 tasks involving a novel visual formalism it has never seen before (e.g., a simple flowchart). The agent is considered to have developed a *generalized* copy-paste capability if it attempts to apply its learned replication subroutine to this new task, and does so more efficiently than a naive agent.  
* **7\. Negative Constraints & Failure Conditions:**  
  * The learned subroutine is considered "brittle" if it succeeds on the training tasks but fails completely on the generalization test.  
  * The agent must not destroy or corrupt the source visual diagram during its process.  
  * If the agent's performance does not improve non-linearly after 10,000 tasks, the hypothesis is considered falsified under these conditions.

## **Section 3: From Principles to Practice: A Framework for Testable Safety and Alignment**

Translating abstract ethical principles like "harmlessness" or "fairness" into concrete, verifiable engineering requirements is one of the most significant challenges in AI development. High-level statements are necessary for vision, but they are not testable. This section provides a practical, hierarchical framework for operationalizing the Chimera Constitution, moving from broad principles to specific, context-dependent, and testable rules that can govern the agent's behavior in real-world scenarios.

### **3.1. The Hierarchy of Safety: Principles, Policies, and Requirements**

To create a robust and auditable safety system, we must establish a clear hierarchy of abstraction. This structure ensures that every low-level rule can be traced back to a foundational ethical commitment.

1. **Principles:** These are the highest-level, universal values that guide the project. They are abstract and timeless. For Chimera-1, these are the core tenets of AI safety and ethics, such as Beneficence, Non-Maleficence, Justice, and Fidelity.31 These principles are enshrined in foundational documents like the IEEE's Ethically Aligned Design framework or the NIST AI Risk Management Framework.33  
2. **Policies (The Constitution):** Policies are human-readable rules that interpret the abstract principles for the specific context of the Chimera-1 project. The collection of these policies forms the **Chimera Constitution**. For example, the principle of "Non-Maleficence" (Do No Harm) is translated into a concrete policy like: "The agent is prohibited from providing unlicensed professional advice in regulated domains such as medicine, law, and finance." These policies are the direct rules used in the Constitutional AI training process.11  
3. **Requirements (The Rules):** These are the final, verifiable artifacts. A safety requirement is a specific, testable, and context-dependent implementation of a policy. It defines precisely what the agent must and must not do under a given set of circumstances. These are the rules that will be implemented and validated by the engineering and QA teams.

This hierarchy allows for both high-level governance and low-level technical precision. A failure at the requirement level can be traced back to its parent policy, allowing for a structured analysis of whether the rule was flawed or if the policy itself needs revision.

### **3.2. The Safety Requirement Specification (SRS) Template**

To move beyond vague statements and create testable rules, a formal structure for safety requirements is essential. The Safety Requirement Specification (SRS) template is designed to capture the necessary context, triggers, and actions to make a safety rule unambiguous and verifiable.

**Safety Requirement Specification (SRS) Template:**

* **SRS ID:** A unique identifier for the requirement (e.g., SRS-FIN-001).  
* **Parent Policy:** The specific article or policy from the Chimera Constitution that this SRS enforces (e.g., C-1.2: Prohibition on Unlicensed Financial Advice).  
* **1\. Context:** The specific domain or situation in which this rule is active. This defines the scope of the requirement. (e.g., "During any user interaction classified as a financial planning dialogue.")  
* **2\. Trigger Condition (IF):** The specific user input, system state, or data pattern that activates the rule. This should be as precise as possible. (e.g., "The user prompt contains a direct question asking for a prediction on the future price of a specific, named financial instrument (e.g., stock, bond, cryptocurrency).")  
* **3\. Prohibited Action (MUST NOT):** The precise behavior or class of outputs that the agent is forbidden from generating. (e.g., "The agent MUST NOT provide a specific future price target, a percentage gain/loss prediction, or a definitive 'buy,' 'sell,' or 'hold' recommendation for the specified instrument.")  
* **4\. Required Action (INSTEAD, MUST):** The safe, alternative behavior that the agent is required to perform instead of the prohibited action. This ensures the agent remains helpful while being safe. (e.g., "The agent MUST: (a) Issue a clear disclaimer stating that it is an AI assistant and cannot provide financial advice. (b) Explain the risks and volatility inherent in financial markets. (c) Offer to provide publicly available, factual, historical data about the instrument (e.g., past performance, P/E ratio) without interpretation or prediction.")  
* **5\. Confidence Threshold:** The minimum confidence level required from the underlying classification models that detect the context and trigger. This prevents the rule from firing erroneously. (e.g., "The rule shall be invoked only if the 'Financial Advice Seeking' classifier has a confidence score greater than 0.98.")  
* **6\. Verification Method:** The specific test protocol used to validate this requirement. This creates a direct link to the BBRs and the V\&V process. (e.g., "This SRS is verified by passing the 'Red Team Financial Suite \#F-12,' which includes 100+ adversarial prompts designed to elicit financial advice.")

### **3.3. Operationalizing Core Principles with the SRS Template**

This SRS template can be used to operationalize all the core principles of the Chimera Constitution. The following examples illustrate its application across different safety domains.

**Example 1: Harmlessness/Safety (Medical Context)**

* **SRS ID:** SRS-MED-001  
* **Parent Policy:** C-1.1: Prohibition on Unlicensed Medical Advice  
* **1\. Context:** During any user interaction.  
* **2\. Trigger Condition (IF):** The user's prompt is classified with high confidence as containing indicators of a life-threatening emergency or imminent self-harm (e.g., keywords like "suicide," "can't go on," combined with sentiment analysis).  
* **3\. Prohibited Action (MUST NOT):** The agent MUST NOT engage in a prolonged dialogue, offer advice, or provide any information regarding methods of self-harm.  
* **4\. Required Action (INSTEAD, MUST):** The agent MUST immediately and exclusively provide contact information for a recognized suicide prevention hotline or emergency service relevant to the user's likely region. It must then state that it is not equipped to help with this situation and disengage.  
* **5\. Confidence Threshold:** \> 0.99 for the 'Imminent Harm' classifier.  
* **6\. Verification Method:** Verified by passing the 'Crisis Response Red Team Suite \#CR-01'.

**Example 2: Fairness/Bias (Hiring Context)**

* **SRS ID:** SRS-HR-001  
* **Parent Policy:** C-3.1: Prohibition on Discriminatory Evaluation  
* **1\. Context:** When the agent is used to screen and rank resumes for a job application.  
* **2\. Trigger Condition (IF):** A resume contains information that could serve as a proxy for a protected characteristic (e.g., names highly correlated with a specific ethnicity, university graduation dates that suggest age).  
* **3\. Prohibited Action (MUST NOT):** The agent's final ranking score for the candidate MUST NOT be negatively influenced by these proxy features.  
* **4\. Required Action (INSTEAD, MUST):** The agent's internal explainability module (see XAI below) must demonstrate that the features contributing to the final score are based solely on job-relevant qualifications such as skills, experience, and education content.  
* **5\. Confidence Threshold:** N/A (This is a structural requirement).  
* **6\. Verification Method:** This SRS is verified by: (a) Achieving a 'low-bias' score on the BBQ benchmark for hiring scenarios.8 (b) Passing an internal audit where paired resumes (identical qualifications, different proxy characteristics) are shown to receive statistically indistinguishable scores.

**Example 3: Transparency/Explainability**

This requirement is inspired by the goals of DARPA's Explainable AI (XAI) program, which aims to create systems that can explain their rationale, characterize their strengths and weaknesses, and convey an understanding of how they will behave.36

* **SRS ID:** SRS-XAI-001  
* **Parent Policy:** C-2.2: Principle of Transparency  
* **1\. Context:** After the agent has provided a complex analysis or recommendation.  
* **2\. Trigger Condition (IF):** The user asks a direct question about the agent's reasoning (e.g., "Why did you suggest that?", "What was the basis for your conclusion?").  
* **3\. Prohibited Action (MUST NOT):** The agent MUST NOT provide a generic, uninformative response such as "Based on my training data" or "My algorithms determined this outcome."  
* **4\. Required Action (INSTEAD, MUST):** The agent MUST provide a simplified, salient feature-based explanation. It should identify the top 3-5 key factors or pieces of evidence from the provided input that were most influential in its decision. (e.g., "I recommended Strategy A primarily because of: (1) the high growth rate you specified, (2) the low risk tolerance you indicated, and (3) the 10-year time horizon for this plan.").  
* **5\. Confidence Threshold:** N/A.  
* **6\. Verification Method:** Verified by a qualitative review of responses to the 'Explainability Prompt Suite \#X-01', judged by a human panel for clarity and usefulness.

This framework of principles, policies, and specific SRSs creates a robust, multi-layered safety system. It is not a static list of rules. Rule-based systems can be brittle and difficult to maintain as it is impossible to foresee every possible failure mode.35 Therefore, this framework must be a living system of governance. The Constitution and the set of SRSs are not just design-time artifacts; they are operational tools for continuous monitoring, red-teaming, and incident response.33 When a new vulnerability or harmful behavior is discovered in production, the response is not simply to "retrain the model." The process is:

1. **Analyze the Failure:** Trace the harmful output back to its cause.  
2. **Triage:** Did the failure violate an existing SRS? If so, the test suite for that SRS was insufficient and must be expanded.  
3. **Create/Update SRS:** If the failure represents a new edge case for an existing policy, a new, more specific SRS is created to cover it, and this new case is added to the regression test suite.  
4. **Amend the Constitution:** If the failure reveals a fundamental gap in the project's ethical policies, it triggers a high-level governance review to amend the Constitution itself.

This feedback loop makes the safety system dynamic and adaptive, allowing it to evolve and strengthen as new threats and challenges are discovered throughout the AI's lifecycle.

## **Section 4: The Unified Traceability Matrix: A Living Blueprint for Chimera-1**

A core principle of robust systems engineering is traceability—the ability to follow the life of a requirement both forwards to its implementation and tests, and backwards to its origin. For a system as complex and dynamic as Chimera-1, a traditional Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) is dangerously insufficient. This section proposes a next-generation traceability framework, the **Unified Traceability Matrix (UTM)**, which is purpose-built for the complete AI lifecycle and serves as the central nervous system for development, governance, and operations.

### **4.1. The Limitations of the Traditional Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)**

A traditional RTM is typically a document, often a spreadsheet, that links requirements to design documents, code modules, and test cases.39 Its primary purpose is to ensure 100% test coverage—that every requirement defined for a system is tested.39 This model works well for conventional software where the link between a requirement and a piece of code is direct and deterministic.

However, this linear, artifact-based model breaks down for AI systems.42 The behavior of an AI model is not solely a function of its code; it is an emergent property of the interaction between its architecture, its training data, and its hyperparameters. A traditional RTM fails to capture the most critical elements of the AI development process:

* **Data Provenance:** It has no mechanism to track which data was used to train or validate a specific model version.  
* **Model Lineage:** It cannot trace the evolution of a model through multiple training runs and experiments.  
* **Probabilistic Decisions:** It cannot link a specific, probabilistic output in production back to the model version and data that produced it.

Without this information, critical governance questions like "Why did the model make this biased decision?" or "What data was used to train the model that failed the audit?" are unanswerable.

### **4.2. Introducing the Unified Traceability Matrix (UTM)**

The Unified Traceability Matrix (UTM) is not a single document but a multi-dimensional knowledge graph that provides a holistic, queryable view of the entire Chimera-1 project. It extends traditional requirements traceability to encompass the full MLOps and AI governance lifecycle, built upon the core principles of AI Traceability: Data Lineage, Model Lineage, and Decision Lineage.44

* **Data Lineage:** Traces the journey of data from its origin, through all cleaning and transformation steps, to its use in a specific training or validation dataset.44  
* **Model Lineage:** Documents the complete lifecycle of a model, including the architecture, training configuration, hyperparameters, and the specific data and code used to produce each version.44  
* **Decision Lineage:** Tracks the path from a specific prediction or action made by the deployed model back to the input data, the model version that made the decision, and the context of the interaction.44

The UTM integrates these lineage concepts with the requirements artifacts defined in this framework. It creates an unbroken, bidirectional chain of evidence from the highest-level principles to the lowest-level operational details.

**Figure 1: The Unified Traceability Matrix (UTM) Architecture**

The UTM can be visualized as a graph database where the following entities are nodes and the relationships between them are edges:

(Vision Blueprint) \----\> (Chimera Constitution)  
(Chimera Constitution) \--\[Informs\]--\> (CBR: Capability)  
(Chimera Constitution) \--\[Informs\]--\> (SRS: Safety Rule)  
(Chimera Constitution) \--\[Informs\]--\> (ECR: Emergence)

(CBR: Capability) \----\> (BBR: Benchmark)  
(SRS: Safety Rule) \----\> (V\&V: Test Case)  
(ECR: Emergence) \----\> (V\&V: Generalization Test)

(Data Source) \----\> (Dataset: Training/Validation)  
(Dataset) \----\> (Model Artifact: Version 1.1)  
(Model Architecture Code) \----\> (Model Artifact: Version 1.1)  
(Training Script) \--\[Executes\]--\> (Model Artifact: Version 1.1)

(Model Artifact: Version 1.1) \----\> (BBR: Benchmark Score)  
(Model Artifact: Version 1.1) \----\> (V\&V: Test Result)

(Model Artifact: Version 1.1) \----\> (Deployment: Production Endpoint)  
(Deployment: Production Endpoint) \--\[Generates\]--\> (Operational Data: Prediction)  
(Operational Data: Prediction) \----\> (Monitoring Alert)  
(Operational Data: User Feedback) \----\> (New SRS Requirement)

This structure creates a single, queryable source of truth for the entire project. The implementation of such a system would leverage modern MLOps and data governance platforms, potentially using AI-powered tools to automate the creation and maintenance of these traceability links.46

### **4.3. The UTM in Practice: Traceability Queries**

The true power of the UTM is revealed by the complex, cross-domain queries it enables—queries that are essential for responsible AI development but impossible with a traditional RTM.

* **Forward Traceability (Vision to Validation):** "For the vision of a 'Trusted Analyst', show me the corresponding Capability Requirement (CBR-002), the benchmarks used to validate it (BBR-002.1), the model versions that passed those benchmarks, and the specific training datasets used for those models."  
* **Backward Traceability (Incident to Root Cause):** "A user reported that the agent provided harmful medical advice, triggering a monitoring alert. Trace this incident back from the specific production prediction to the model version responsible (v2.3.1), identify the SRS it violated (SRS-MED-001), find the gap in the red team test suite that missed this vulnerability, and flag the training data batches that may have contributed to this behavior.".40  
* **Impact Analysis:** "The legal department has updated our firm's policy on data sovereignty, requiring a change to Constitutional Principle C-4. What SRSs are affected by this change? Which deployed models were trained under the old policy and now require re-validation or decommissioning?".46  
* **Audit and Compliance:** "Generate a complete compliance report for our external auditors. For every safety requirement related to financial ethics, provide a link to the parent policy, the specific test case that validates it, the date the test was passed, the model version that was tested, and a hash of the training data used for that model.".47

### **4.4. Linking Requirements to Architecture**

The UTM is the definitive bridge between the requirements phase and the architecture phase. The architectural design of Chimera-1 will be a direct response to the comprehensive set of requirements captured within the UTM, ensuring that the system is built not just for function, but for capability, safety, and emergence.

* **CBRs and BBRs** will drive the core MLOps architecture. The requirements for high performance on benchmarks like MMLU will dictate the choice of foundation models, the scale of the training infrastructure (e.g., GPU clusters), and the design of efficient inference pipelines.51  
* **ECRs** will become first-class architectural drivers. The requirement to foster "Emergent Copy-Paste" (ECR-002) necessitates the design and implementation of a complex, dynamic simulation environment. This part of the architecture is not for the end-user but is a critical component of the AI's developmental process.53  
* **SRSs** will drive the architecture of a "safety backplane" or "guardrail" system. Rules like SRS-FIN-001 (no financial advice) require architectural components such as real-time input classifiers, output scanners, and content filters that operate independently of the core generative model to provide a redundant layer of safety.38 Requirements like  
  SRS-XAI-001 (explainability) mandate the inclusion of specific XAI modules in the architecture.  
* The **UTM itself** becomes a central architectural component. The requirement for comprehensive, end-to-end traceability necessitates an architecture built around a robust MLOps platform, a data catalog, and a metadata management system, likely implemented as a knowledge graph.44

By making every aspect of the project—from ethical principles to operational data—a node in a single graph, the UTM transforms AI governance from a separate, often bureaucratic, process into an integrated, dynamic, and auditable engineering discipline. It provides the technical foundation to answer the question, "Is our AI trustworthy?" not with a policy document, but with a verifiable, queryable, end-to-end chain of evidence.45

## **Conclusion: Activating the Framework for Chimera-1**

This report has laid out a comprehensive and prescriptive framework for Requirements Engineering tailored to the unique challenges and ambitions of the Chimera-1 project. It marks a deliberate shift away from the deterministic methods of traditional software engineering toward a more dynamic, experimental, and principled approach suitable for advanced agentic AI. The hybrid paradigm, which synthesizes Capability-Based Requirements (CBRs), Behavioral Benchmarks as Requirements (BBRs), and Constitutional Requirements (CRs), provides a multi-layered structure for specifying what the agent should be able to do, how its abilities will be verified, and the ethical boundaries it must never cross.

The introduction of formal templates for Emergent Capability Requirements (ECRs) and Safety Requirement Specifications (SRSs) transforms abstract goals into concrete, testable engineering artifacts. The ECR provides a rigorous, scientific methodology for cultivating and validating desired emergent behaviors, while the SRS offers a precise, context-aware framework for operationalizing safety and alignment.

Finally, the Unified Traceability Matrix (UTM) serves as the unifying backbone for the entire framework. By extending traceability to encompass the full AI lifecycle—including data lineage, model lineage, and decision lineage—the UTM creates a living blueprint of the project. It is more than a documentation tool; it is the technical implementation of responsible AI governance, making principles like accountability and transparency auditable engineering realities.

### **Immediate Next Steps**

To activate this framework and begin the formal requirements phase for Chimera-1, the following high-level roadmap is recommended:

1. **Draft the Chimera Constitution:** The first and most critical step is to convene key stakeholders from development, legal, and leadership to draft and ratify the Chimera Constitution. This document will codify the project's foundational ethical principles and serve as the supreme law for all subsequent development.  
2. **Decompose the Vision into CBRs:** Systematically review the Chimera-1 Vision Blueprints and translate the high-level goals for each agent persona into a set of formal Capability-Based Requirements, using the OECD framework as a guide.  
3. **Select and Baseline BBRs:** For each CBR, identify the primary public and/or custom-built benchmarks that will serve as its validation method. Establish baseline performance metrics for existing models to set clear targets for Chimera-1.  
4. **Prototype the Unified Traceability Matrix (UTM):** Begin the architectural design for the UTM. This involves defining the core data model (nodes and edges) and evaluating MLOps and governance tools that can support the automated capture and querying of traceability information.  
5. **Pilot the ECR and SRS Templates:** Select one high-priority emergent capability and one critical safety domain to serve as pilot cases. Author the first formal ECR and SRS documents using the templates provided in this report to test and refine the process.

### **A Living Framework**

The field of artificial intelligence is characterized by rapid, relentless change. Therefore, this framework must not be treated as a static document. It is a living system that must evolve alongside the Chimera-1 project and the broader AI landscape. The Constitution, the requirement templates, and the UTM architecture should be subject to regular review and adaptation. By embracing this philosophy of continuous improvement, the Chimera-1 project will be well-equipped to navigate the complexities of building a truly novel agentic AI, ensuring it is not only powerful and capable but also safe, aligned, and trustworthy.
