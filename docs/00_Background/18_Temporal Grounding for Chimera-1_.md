# **A Blueprint for a Temporally-Grounded Mind**

This report presents the final architectural layer for the Chimera-1 initiative, designed to imbue the agent with a profound and intuitive understanding of time. Moving beyond static, atemporal reasoning, this blueprint details a comprehensive strategy to enable Chimera-1 to perceive dynamic events, process temporal sequences, reason under temporal constraints, and act with temporal awareness. This capacity is architected upon four foundational pillars: **Unified Spatiotemporal Perception**, an **Architectural Pacemaker** for internal temporal processing, **Agentic Temporality** for action and planning, and a **Grand Synthesis** for integration. The following table provides an executive summary of the core components proposed in this blueprint, which acts as a roadmap for the detailed sections that follow.

## **Part I: The "Eyes of Time" — A Unified Spatiotemporal Perceptual System**

The foundation of any temporal reasoning system is its ability to perceive a dynamic world accurately. This section details the input-facing modules that transform raw, dynamic sensory data—video and audio—into a rich, temporally-coherent representation. This is not a passive act of recording but an active process of deconstruction, interpretation, and synthesis, forming the bedrock of Chimera-1's awareness of the world in motion.

### **1.1 Visual Dynamics Encoding: From Pixels to Motion Primitives**

To understand dynamic events, a model must see beyond static frames and perceive the flow of motion, the interaction between objects, and the evolution of a scene over time. The proposed visual encoding system is engineered to capture this dynamism through a multi-faceted architecture that prioritizes motion coherence and semantic richness.

#### **1.1.1 A Committee of Experts: The MERV Architecture**

The design rejects the "one-size-fits-all" philosophy of relying on a single visual backbone, which inevitably possesses inherent strengths and limitations.1 A model trained for fine-grained object recognition may lack the capacity to understand complex temporal actions, and vice-versa. To overcome this, the architecture will be based on the

**Multi-Encoder Representation of Videos (MERV)** framework.1 MERV leverages a team of frozen, specialized encoders that process video frames in parallel. Their diverse outputs are then intelligently fused to provide a comprehensive and nuanced visual understanding that a single encoder could not achieve alone.20

The MERV module for Chimera-1 will integrate four distinct visual experts, each selected for its state-of-the-art performance in a specific domain of visual understanding 1:

1. **Spatial Expert (DINOv2):** Trained using unsupervised learning on local-to-global correspondences, DINOv2 excels at fine-grained object part understanding and robust semantic segmentation. It provides the "what" of the scene with high fidelity.1  
2. **Temporal Expert (ViViT):** This Vision Transformer is explicitly designed for video, using spatial and temporal attention to model the interactions between frames. It captures longer temporal dependencies, providing a deep understanding of the "how" and the motion dynamics of an action.1  
3. **Image-Language Contrastive Expert (SigLIP):** Trained on vast image-text pairs, SigLIP learns a joint embedding space that grounds the visual percept in language. This is crucial for understanding the semantic context and vision-language associations.1  
4. **Video-Language Contrastive Expert (LanguageBind):** This expert extends the grounding to the video domain, understanding high-level semantics and the relationship between an entire video clip and its textual description. It is trained through joint multimodal learning across video, audio, and text, providing a holistic semantic overview.1

By processing a video through this parallel committee, the system generates a set of complementary feature streams. One stream might highlight the precise geometry of objects, another the flow of movement, and others the semantic labels and descriptions. This multi-faceted representation is far richer than any single perspective.

#### **1.1.2 Instilling a Motion Prior: The VideoJAM Objective**

A critical flaw in many video models is that their training objective—typically pixel reconstruction—biases them toward appearance fidelity at the expense of motion coherence. This can lead to visually plausible but physically nonsensical outputs, like objects passing through each other.2 To correct this, the training of the entire visual encoding system will be augmented with the

**VideoJAM** framework.2

VideoJAM modifies the training objective to be a **joint appearance-motion** task. Instead of only predicting the pixels of the next frame, the model is also required to predict the corresponding motion, represented as an optical flow field.22 This is achieved by adding two linear layers to the base architecture: one at the input to combine the noised video and motion signals into a single representation, and one at the output to extract the motion prediction from this learned joint representation.22 During inference, an "Inner-Guidance" mechanism leverages the model's own evolving motion prediction as a dynamic signal to steer the generation toward temporally coherent outputs.22 By forcing the model to explicitly learn and predict motion, VideoJAM instills a powerful and effective motion prior, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence and physical plausibility of its understanding.2

#### **1.1.3 Efficient Fusion and Long-Video Processing**

The heterogeneous features from the four experts must be fused into a single, coherent representation. The MERV architecture accomplishes this with a **cross-attentive encoder mixer**.1 This module uses a set of learnable queries to probe the outputs of the different encoders, dynamically weighing and combining their information based on the input data's characteristics. This is more effective than simple concatenation, as it allows the model to learn which expert to "trust" more for a given task or video segment.27

Handling long videos presents a significant computational challenge due to the explosion of visual tokens. To manage this, the architecture will incorporate principles from state-of-the-art long video models. Inspired by **LongVLM**, long videos will be decomposed into multiple short-term segments, with features extracted locally for each segment and then concatenated to preserve the temporal order and storyline.28 Furthermore, the

**VideoStreaming** model's memory-propagated streaming encoding will be employed to sequentially encode clips into condensed memories, preserving spatial cues and temporal dynamics while creating a fixed-length global representation for arbitrarily long videos.29

Finally, to ensure that the model focuses on the most relevant temporal information, it will use the adaptive frame selection mechanism from **Balanced-VLLM**.30 This module uses the text prompt or current task objective to identify and select the most relevant frames for processing, preventing crucial temporal cues in short, key events from being overshadowed by spatially redundant information from less important frames. This active selection process is a departure from passive, uniform frame sampling and is crucial for efficient and effective temporal reasoning. The combination of a multi-expert committee, an explicit motion-centric training objective, and an intelligent, task-guided fusion and sampling strategy creates a perceptual front-end that is not merely a passive recorder of pixels but an active interpreter of dynamic events.

### **1.2 Auditory Dynamics Encoding: The Cadence of Reality**

Audio is an equally rich source of temporal information. The cadence of speech, the rhythm of music, and the timing of environmental sounds are all critical for a complete understanding of a dynamic scene. The proposed auditory encoder moves beyond simple spectral representations to explicitly capture the temporal structure inherent in sound.

#### **1.2.1 Capturing Rhythm with Frame-Aligned Character Sequences**

The core of the auditory encoder will be built around a novel representation designed to capture speech rhythm: **Frame-Aligned Character Sequences (FACS)**.31 Traditional methods often rely on spectrograms, which represent frequency content over time but do not explicitly encode the duration-based patterns of speech that constitute rhythm. Rhythm is a highly idiosyncratic feature, robust to noise and channel variations, making it a powerful signal for understanding.3

The generation of FACS is a two-step process 32:

1. **Time-Aligned Transcription:** A robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) model with time-stamping capabilities, such as WhisperX, is used to generate a transcript of the audio with character-level time stamps.31  
2. **Frame-by-Frame Conversion:** The time-stamped transcript is converted into a sequence with a fixed frame rate (e.g., one character per 20 ms frame). Each character is repeated for the number of frames corresponding to its spoken duration. A special null character is used to represent non-speech frames, thereby capturing the prosodic information conveyed by pauses and gaps.32

This representation transforms the audio signal into a sequence that explicitly encodes the temporal structure of speech. The length of character repetitions directly represents the cadence of spoken words, a fundamental component of rhythm. The model that processes this sequence can therefore learn these temporal patterns directly.

#### **1.2.2 Hierarchical Prosody for Multi-Scale Temporal Features**

Speech dynamics occur across multiple timescales, from the rapid articulation of phonemes to the slower contour of sentences. This hierarchical structure is mirrored in the brain, where different neural oscillations appear to track corresponding perceptual units of speech (e.g., gamma for phonemes, theta for syllables, delta for phrases).34 To equip Chimera-1 with a similar multi-scale understanding, the FACS representation will be augmented with

**Hierarchical Prosody Controls (HPCs)**.4

HPCs are a set of features extracted directly from the audio recording that capture prosodic information at various levels of granularity. This includes measurements of fundamental frequency (pitch), energy, and duration at the phone, syllable, word, and sentence levels.4 By combining the fine-grained rhythmic information from FACS with the multi-scale prosodic information from HPCs, the system generates an exceptionally rich temporal representation of the audio stream.

The encoder architecture for this combined representation will be a **transformer**, which is highly effective at modeling patterns in sequential data.31 To ensure that the learned representations capture prosody independent of speaker identity, techniques for disentanglement, such as those used in models like CopyCat2 for prosody transfer, will be incorporated.35 This allows the model to learn a generalized understanding of rhythm and prosody that is not overfitted to the voices in its training data.

### **1.3 Multimodal Fusion: Weaving a Coherent World Percept**

With rich, dynamic representations from both the visual and auditory streams, the final step in perception is to fuse them into a single, coherent percept. The nature of this fusion is critical; it must be deep enough to capture subtle cross-modal correlations and flexible enough to adapt to the wide variety of ways audio and video can interact in the real world.

#### **1.3.1 Early and Event-Specific Fusion**

The architecture will employ an **early-fusion** strategy, where unimodal representations are combined at early layers of the network.6 This approach, in contrast to late or decision-level fusion, promotes the learning of deeply integrated representations by forcing the model to understand the fine-grained interactions between modalities from the outset. Late fusion, which combines the outputs of separate unimodal classifiers, often results in a significant loss of cross-modal information.36

Furthermore, the fusion mechanism will not be a monolithic, "one-size-fits-all" module. Real-world events exhibit diverse audio-visual relationships: the tight synchronization of lip movements and speech is different from the rhythmic correspondence of a drummer and their music, which is different still from the instantaneous crack of a bat hitting a ball. Inspired by this observation, the fusion module will be a multi-head model with individual, **event-specific fusion layers**.38 These specialized layers will be designed to handle distinct types of audio-visual relationships, including:

* **Continuous Correlation Layer:** For events where audio and visual streams are tightly and continuously aligned over time, such as dialogue.  
* **Rhythmic/Repetitive Event Layer:** For events characterized by a clear, repeating temporal pattern, such as dancing, clapping, or walking.  
* **Instantaneous/Onset Event Layer:** For events where a sudden, sharp sound corresponds to a specific visual moment, such as an impact or an explosion.

This architecture allows the model to learn to dynamically route information through the most appropriate fusion pathway based on the characteristics of the event it is perceiving.

#### **1.3.2 Deep Localized Fusion and Masked Reconstruction Training**

The core mechanism within each event-specific layer will be based on the **DeepAVFusion** framework.6 This involves a novel

**attention-based fusion module** that attends to the interactions between *local* audio and visual representations (e.g., patch-level visual tokens and short-time audio tokens). This allows the model to capture fine-grained, localized interactions—such as the sound of a specific object in a complex visual scene—which is crucial for tasks like sound localization and audio-visual segmentation. To manage the computational cost of attending to all pairwise local interactions, which can be intractable, the architecture will employ a factorization procedure that reduces complexity while preserving the ability to model these essential local relationships.6

The entire perceptual system—the visual encoders, the auditory encoder, and the event-specific fusion module—will be trained jointly using a powerful self-supervised **masked reconstruction framework**.6 In this paradigm, random portions of both the audio and visual input streams are masked out. The model's objective is to reconstruct the missing data from the limited, cross-modal context it can see. This forces the model to learn the deep, intricate correlations between the senses. To reconstruct a masked face while hearing speech, it must learn the principles of lip-sync. To reconstruct the sound of a car crash from video, it must learn the relationship between visual impacts and their corresponding sounds. This training objective has been shown to be highly effective for learning robust, general-purpose audio-visual representations without requiring massive labeled datasets.5

The result of this multi-stage perceptual system is a rich, dynamic, and deeply integrated representation of the world. It is a world not of static images and generic sounds, but of coherent events, where motion, rhythm, and cross-modal relationships are explicitly encoded. This forms the essential input for the higher-level temporal reasoning faculties of Chimera-1.

## **Part II: The "Internal Clock" — Architectural Foundations for Temporal Processing**

Once the world is perceived as a dynamic stream of events, the agent requires a core computational engine to process this information over time. This section defines this engine—the architectural equivalent of an internal clock or pacemaker—which provides Chimera-1 with an intrinsic sense of time, enabling it to model long-range dependencies, sequence its operations, and maintain a coherent representation of temporal flow. This is achieved through a powerful combination of a state-of-the-art sequence model and a novel, bio-inspired rhythmic modulator.

### **2.1 The Pacemaker Core: Mamba as a Selective State Space Model**

The central temporal processor for Chimera-1 will be a **Mamba-based State Space Model (SSM)**.7 The choice of Mamba is a direct response to a fundamental limitation of the Transformer architecture that has dominated sequence modeling: its computational and memory complexity, which scales quadratically with sequence length (

O(L2)). This makes processing the very long, high-resolution temporal sequences generated by our perceptual system prohibitively expensive for Transformers. Mamba, in contrast, processes sequences with linear complexity (O(L)), making it exceptionally well-suited for our purposes.7

Mamba's efficiency stems from its modernization of the classical SSM framework, which has long been a cornerstone of time-series analysis and dynamic systems modeling.39 A classical SSM models a system by assuming that an observed time series is generated by an unobserved, latent state that evolves over time according to a transition equation. Mamba builds upon this by making the SSM's core parameters (

A,B,C) data-dependent. This creates a **selective scan mechanism**, allowing the model to dynamically and selectively propagate or forget information based on the content of the current input.7 This "selectivity" is what gives Mamba its power to handle tasks with very long-range dependencies, as it can choose to maintain a piece of information in its hidden state for thousands of timesteps if needed, while a standard RNN might forget it and a Transformer would struggle with the computational cost.

The architectural implementation will be adapted from the **Multi-scale Temporal Mamba (MS-Temba)** model, which was designed for action detection in long, untrimmed videos.7 This architecture is particularly suitable as it is built to handle multiple temporal scales. The fused spatiotemporal percept from Part I will be fed into a series of

**Temba Blocks**. Each block contains two key components:

* A **Temporal Local Module (TLM)** for modeling short-range temporal relationships.  
* A **Dilated Temporal SSM (DTS)**, a novel application of dilations to the Mamba architecture, which allows it to efficiently capture long-range dependencies at multiple scales.

The outputs from these multi-scale blocks are then aggregated by a final **Temba Fuser**, which is itself another Mamba layer, to produce a comprehensive, multi-scale representation of the entire temporal sequence. This hierarchical structure aligns perfectly with the multi-scale nature of the perceptual inputs and the demands of complex temporal reasoning.

### **2.2 Bio-Inspired Rhythmic Circuits: Modulating Information Flow**

While the Mamba core serves as a powerful and efficient processing engine, it operates as a monolithic stream. Biological intelligence, however, suggests that temporal processing is not just about efficient computation but also about coordination and prioritization, often orchestrated by neural oscillations or "brain waves".34 These rhythms do not perform the computation themselves but act to modulate and gate the flow of information, allowing the brain to flexibly attend to different stimuli, sequence operations, and switch contexts.

To emulate this capability, the architecture will include a novel, bio-inspired **Rhythmic Modulator** layer. This module acts as a conductor for the Mamba engine, generating task-relevant oscillations that provide a global "clock signal" to control the flow of information. This design is grounded in several lines of research:

1. Studies on ANNs have shown that adding a simple rhythmic inhibition (e.g., a 10Hz sine wave, akin to alpha oscillations) to a trained network can allow it to **multiplex competing inputs into a temporal code**.9 This rhythmic suppression enables the network to process multiple simultaneous inputs by segregating them in time, solving a critical bottleneck problem without changing the network's weights.  
2. Research on Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) has demonstrated that when trained on tasks like speech recognition, they can **spontaneously emerge with a hierarchy of neural oscillations** (delta, theta, gamma) that directly correspond to the perceptual units of speech (phrases, syllables, phonemes).34 This shows a deep, functional link between rhythmic activity and hierarchical temporal processing.

The Rhythmic Modulator will be implemented as a small, separate neural network that is trained to generate a low-dimensional oscillatory signal, o(t). This signal will act as a dynamic, multiplicative gate on the input to the Mamba core, x(t), such that the effective input becomes x′(t)=x(t)⋅o(t). The parameters of the modulator, which control the frequency, phase, and amplitude of its oscillations, will be learned end-to-end with the rest of the system. This allows the modulator to learn to generate the specific "beat" or "cadence" that is most effective for the task at hand. For a task requiring rapid attention switching, it might learn a high-frequency oscillation; for a task requiring integration over a long period, it might learn a slow one.

For more advanced, adaptive capabilities, the system will explore the paradigm of **Rhythmic Sharing**.10 In this model, inspired by the rhythmic activity of astrocytes in the brain, the link strengths within the network themselves oscillate. The learning process involves coordinating the

*phases* of these oscillations. This allows the network to rapidly change how information flows through it, enabling it to sense subtle context changes and adapt to new, unseen dynamics in a zero-shot manner. In the context of Chimera-1, the phase of the Rhythmic Modulator's signal could be used to coordinate the state updates within the Mamba core, providing a powerful mechanism for rapid, unsupervised context switching.

This Processor-Modulator design, where the Mamba SSM acts as the high-throughput processor and the Rhythmic Modulator acts as the adaptive conductor, is a direct and sophisticated implementation of an "internal clock." It is a duet, not a solo, providing a system that is far more flexible, powerful, and biologically plausible than a single component could be.

### **2.3 An Alternative Pathway: Liquid Time-Constant Dynamics**

While the Mamba-Oscillator combination forms the primary architectural proposal, a responsible research program must also investigate promising alternative technologies. **Liquid Time-Constant Networks (LTCs)** represent a fundamentally different and compelling approach to continuous-time modeling.44

LTCs are a class of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) whose underlying dynamics are described by a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). Their key innovation is that the **time-constants** of these ODEs—parameters that characterize the response speed and sensitivity of each neuron—are not fixed. Instead, they are themselves a dynamic, nonlinear function of the network's hidden state and its current input.45 This "liquid" nature allows the network to fluidly and continuously adjust its processing strategy in real-time. If the input signal is changing rapidly, the time-constants can adapt to make the network more responsive; if the signal is stable, the network can become less sensitive, integrating information over longer periods.

This inherent adaptability makes LTCs exceptionally well-suited for environments with highly non-static, unpredictable, or even chaotic temporal patterns where a fixed-parameter model might fail.44 Therefore, a parallel research track will be established to evaluate LTCs. This investigation will explore their potential as either a direct alternative to the Mamba core for specific domains where their unique properties are most advantageous, or as a specialized component within the broader Chimera-1 architecture, perhaps serving as a dedicated model for highly volatile time-series prediction.

## **Part III: "The Game" — Cultivating Agentic Temporality**

A sophisticated perception of time and a powerful internal clock are necessary but not sufficient. To be truly grounded in time, an agent must be able to translate its temporal understanding into effective, goal-directed action and strategic planning. This section details the architectural components and training methodologies that will enable Chimera-1 to plan under duress, act with an awareness of deadlines, and engage in strategic interactions where timing is paramount.

### **3.1 Planning Under Duress: Integrating Temporal Constraints**

An agent's policy and planning capabilities must be explicitly aware of temporal constraints. A decision that is optimal with an hour remaining may be catastrophic with only a second left. The framework for instilling this awareness is drawn directly from the findings of "Time Limits in Reinforcement Learning" 11, which makes a critical distinction between two types of tasks.

1. **For Fixed-Horizon Tasks:** In scenarios where the agent's objective is to maximize performance over a fixed period (e.g., "complete this task in 30 seconds"), the time limit is an integral part of the environment. To ensure the agent's policy can learn optimal time-dependent behaviors, the **"time remaining" will be represented as a normalized scalar and concatenated to the state vector** as a direct input to the policy and value networks.11 This prevents a critical failure mode called state aliasing, where the agent cannot distinguish between a state with ample time and the same state near a deadline, leading to flawed value estimates and suboptimal policies. With time as an input, the agent can learn policies like "when time is low, choose the faster, lower-reward option."  
2. **For Indefinite-Horizon Tasks:** In many cases, time limits are used during training simply to diversify experience by resetting the environment frequently, even though the underlying task has no natural time limit. In these cases, treating the timeout as a terminal state is incorrect, as it teaches the agent that the world simply ends, depressing the value of all states. To correct this, the training will employ **Partial-Episode Bootstrapping (PEB)**.11 When an episode terminates due to a timeout, the value function update will still bootstrap from the estimated value of the final state. This correctly signals to the agent that the episode was artificially cut short and that more reward would have been available, allowing it to learn an accurate value function for the true, infinite-horizon task.

To bridge the gap between low-level reinforcement learning and high-level symbolic planning, the architecture will implement the framework from "Synthesis of Search Heuristics for Temporal Planning via Reinforcement Learning".17 This involves training an RL agent on a distribution of temporal planning problems to learn a value function,

V(s). This learned value function is then transformed into a powerful planning heuristic, h(s), using the mathematical relationship h(s)=logγ​(V(s)), where γ is the discount factor. This learned heuristic can then be used to guide a semi-symbolic temporal planner, such as TAMER, dramatically improving its scalability and performance on complex problems with rich temporal constraints.17

### **3.2 The Dance of Agents: Modeling Latency and Reaction Time**

In competitive or cooperative multi-agent environments, success often depends not only on predicting *what* an opponent will do, but *when* they will do it. Reaction time, decision-making latency, and network lag are all critical temporal factors. To address this, Chimera-1's agentic capabilities will be built upon a framework that explicitly models opponent temporality.

The core of this system will be **Model-Based Opponent Modeling (MBOM)**.13 MBOM is a sophisticated opponent modeling technique that uses a learned model of the environment to perform recursive reasoning. Instead of just reacting to an opponent's last move, MBOM simulates the interaction from the opponent's perspective, running their likely policy update in the simulated environment to anticipate their next actions.14 This allows the agent to form a higher-level belief about the opponent's strategy.

This established MBOM framework will be extended to explicitly model opponent latency. The standard opponent policy, πopp​(a∣s), which is conditioned only on the state, is insufficient. The proposed model will represent the opponent's policy as being conditioned on an unobserved latency parameter, λopp​, yielding πopp​(a∣s,λopp​). This parameter is a latent variable that can represent a combination of factors, including cognitive processing time, network lag, or physical action execution delays.

The inference of this latency parameter is what allows Chimera-1 to build a temporal model of its opponent. During an interaction, Chimera-1 observes the opponent's sequence of actions and, critically, their timing. It then uses the MBOM simulation engine in a manner analogous to inverse reinforcement learning. It runs multiple simulations of the opponent's decision-making process, each with a different candidate latency parameter λopp​. The inferred latency is the one that causes the simulated behavior to most closely match the opponent's actual, observed behavior.

This inferred latency parameter then becomes a crucial input for Chimera-1's own policy. By having a dynamic, continuously updated model of its opponent's speed, Chimera-1 can engage in a new, higher level of temporal-strategic reasoning. It can learn to identify and exploit an opponent who is slow to react to surprises with fast, unexpected strategies. Conversely, if it infers that an opponent is reacting very quickly, it can deduce that its own strategy has become predictable and switch to a more varied plan. This elevates opponent modeling from a purely action-predictive task to a truly temporal one, grounding abstract strategic reasoning in the concrete, physical reality of time.

## **Part IV: The Grand Synthesis — A Temporally-Aware Chimera-1**

The final stage of this blueprint details the integration of these advanced temporal faculties into the overarching Chimera-1 architecture. This involves modifying the core planning system to operate with temporal awareness and designing a comprehensive, multi-stage pedagogical framework to ensure these complex capabilities are learned in a robust and structured manner.

### **4.1 The Hierarchical Timed Planner**

To enable long-horizon planning and temporal abstraction, Chimera-1's existing Hierarchical Planner will be fundamentally adapted using the **Options Framework** from Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL).15 The Options framework formalizes the intuitive idea of "macro-actions" or "sub-routines" that last for multiple timesteps, providing a powerful tool for temporal abstraction.

The meta-controller, which sits at the highest level of the planner, will no longer issue simple, atemporal goals (e.g., "go to location X"). Instead, it will select an **option**, which is defined as a tuple containing a sub-goal, a lower-level policy to achieve it, and, crucially, a **temporal constraint**. For example, the meta-controller will issue timed sub-goals such as (goal=X, max\_duration=30s). This allows the planner to reason not just about *what* needs to be done, but in *what order* and *how quickly*.

The implementation of this will be based on the **hierarchical-DQN (h-DQN)** architecture.15 This framework uses two hierarchically organized learning modules operating at different timescales:

* **The Meta-Controller:** This top-level module learns a policy, πmeta​(goal∣state), to select the next sub-goal. It is trained to maximize the total *extrinsic* reward from the environment, encouraging it to learn high-level, long-term strategies.  
* **The Controller:** This lower-level module learns a policy, πctrl​(action∣state,goal), to select atomic actions. It is trained to maximize an *intrinsic* reward, which is granted only if it successfully achieves the specific sub-goal given to it by the meta-controller *within the specified time constraint*.

This h-DQN structure creates a clean separation of concerns. The meta-controller focuses on strategic, "what's next" planning, while the controller focuses on tactical, "how-to" execution under temporal pressure. This approach is scalable to a large number of options because the controller can learn a single, goal-conditioned policy rather than a separate policy for every possible sub-goal.48

To provide a rich and expressive language for specifying these complex, timed tasks, the system will integrate a module that translates tasks defined in **Hierarchical Temporal Logic (TL)** into a reward-generating Finite State Automaton (FSA).16 Temporal logic is a formal language capable of expressing intricate logical and temporal relationships between events. This will allow developers and users to specify tasks in a human-like way, such as: "First, preheat the grill until it reaches 400 degrees, then grill the burgers for 4 minutes per side, ensuring the internal temperature reaches 160 degrees, but if a flare-up occurs, immediately move the burgers to indirect heat." The FSA generated from such a specification directly provides the sequence of goals and the intrinsic reward structure for the h-DQN agent, seamlessly bridging the gap between high-level, symbolic task definition and low-level, continuous control.16

### **4.2 A Pedagogical Framework for Temporality**

A cognitive faculty as complex as temporal reasoning cannot be learned monolithically in a single, end-to-end training run. Doing so would be computationally intractable and likely lead to an unstable, poorly generalized model. Instead, Chimera-1 will be trained using a **curriculum-based pedagogical framework** that progressively builds its temporal reasoning capabilities, mirroring the staged manner in which humans and other biological systems develop their understanding of time. This structured approach de-risks the training process, allows for clear diagnostics and validation at each stage, and is far more likely to result in a robust and generalizable final agent.

The proposed pedagogical curriculum consists of five distinct stages:

1. **Stage 1: Foundational Perception.** The initial focus is on building the agent's "senses." The perceptual modules from Part I (the MERV visual system, the FACS auditory encoder, and the DeepAVFusion module) will be pre-trained on large-scale, unlabeled datasets. The training objectives will be self-supervised, including tasks like video-text alignment, action recognition from video, and, most importantly, masked audio-visual reconstruction.6 The goal of this stage is not to perform any specific task, but to learn robust, general-purpose spatiotemporal representations that capture the fundamental dynamics of the physical world.  
2. **Stage 2: Causal and Rhythmic Understanding.** With a solid perceptual foundation, the model will be fine-tuned on datasets designed to explicitly teach temporal concepts. This curriculum will include simple causal videos (e.g., "A pushes B, causing B to fall"), which teach the model about cause and effect. It will also include datasets with distinct rhythms (e.g., music, dance) to refine the rhythmic processing of the auditory and fusion modules. Finally, it will be trained on fine-grained temporal reasoning tasks, using benchmarks that require understanding specific moments in time, similar to those targeted by models like VTimeLLM.18  
3. **Stage 3: Single-Agent Deadlines.** At this stage, the agentic components are introduced. The time-aware policy from Part III is integrated, and the agent is trained on single-player tasks with hard deadlines. The agent must learn to successfully utilize the "time remaining" feature in its state input to make optimal decisions.11 Concurrently, the value function learned during this RL process will be used to bootstrap the training of a symbolic temporal planner, as described in the heuristic synthesis framework.17 This stage teaches the agent to manage its own time.  
4. **Stage 4: Multi-Agent Real-Time Interaction.** The training now moves to more complex, dynamic environments. The agent is placed in multi-agent scenarios where reaction time is a critical factor for success. The latency-aware opponent modeler 13 is trained, forcing the agent to learn not only to manage its own time but also to infer, model, and strategically exploit the temporal characteristics of other agents.  
5. **Stage 5: Long-Horizon Hierarchical Planning.** In the final stage, the fully assembled Chimera-1 agent, complete with its Hierarchical Timed Planner, is deployed in complex, long-horizon tasks. These tasks will be specified using the Temporal Logic framework 16, requiring the agent to autonomously decompose a high-level, temporally complex goal into a timed sequence of achievable sub-goals and execute them successfully. This final stage tests and refines the agent's ability to plan and act over extended periods, fully integrating all its temporal faculties.

This timed pedagogy ensures that each layer of the temporal architecture is built upon a solid and validated foundation. It transforms the monumental challenge of "learning time" into a manageable, progressive sequence of achievable learning objectives.

## **Conclusion**

This blueprint provides a comprehensive, research-grounded, and prescriptive strategy for integrating the dimension of time into the Chimera-1 architecture. The proposed design moves beyond simplistic or monolithic approaches, instead architecting a deeply integrated, multi-component system that addresses temporality at every level of processing, from perception to action.

The foundation is a **Unified Spatiotemporal Perceptual System** that actively interprets dynamic events rather than passively recording them. By combining a committee of specialized visual experts (MERV), a motion-centric training objective (VideoJAM), a rhythm-and-prosody-focused auditory encoder (FACS/HPC), and an event-specific fusion module (DeepAVFusion), this system produces a rich, coherent representation of the world in motion.

This representation is processed by the **Architectural Pacemaker**, a duet between a powerful computational engine and an adaptive modulator. The Mamba SSM core provides the raw power to efficiently process long temporal sequences, while the bio-inspired Rhythmic Modulator acts as a conductor, generating learned oscillations that gate and coordinate the flow of information, providing a true internal clock.

This understanding of time is translated into action through modules for **Agentic Temporality**. A time-aware policy, augmented with the "time remaining" and trained with proper bootstrapping, allows the agent to plan under duress. A novel latency-aware opponent modeler elevates multi-agent strategy by enabling the agent to reason about the timing of its opponents, not just their actions.

Finally, the **Grand Synthesis** integrates these capabilities into a cohesive whole. The Hierarchical Timed Planner, built on the h-DQN framework and guided by tasks specified in Temporal Logic, allows the agent to form and execute complex, long-horizon plans with explicit temporal constraints. The entire system is brought to life through a carefully designed **Temporal Pedagogy Curriculum**, which builds these sophisticated faculties in a structured, progressive, and robust manner.

This is the final design that will allow Chimera-1 to move beyond the static and atemporal. It is the blueprint that will allow our model to not just exist, but to *endure*.
