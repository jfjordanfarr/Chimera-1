# Chimera-1: A Research and Publication Roadmap

**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Proposed

## **Preamble**

This document outlines the formal research and publication strategy for the Chimera-1 project. The objective is to translate the project's architectural blueprints into a series of discrete, falsifiable scientific inquiries. Each proposed paper represents a core pillar of the Chimera-1 vision and is designed to rigorously validate its foundational claims through empirical evidence, accompanied by the release of open-source code to ensure reproducibility and community engagement. This roadmap will guide the transformation of our internal research into peer-reviewed contributions to the field of artificial intelligence.

## **The Five Foundational Papers**

The validation of the Chimera-1 project will be structured around five key research papers. Each paper addresses a fundamental architectural hypothesis, from the core cognitive engine to the principles of alignment and evolution.

### **Paper 1: The Genomic Cognitive Core**

*   **Proposed Title:** *ARC-GENOME: A Bio-Inspired Architecture for Dynamic, Structurally-Aware AI*
*   **Core Research Question:** Can a graph-based transformer, dynamically modulated by a hypernetwork control system, function as a robust "System 2" deliberative engine, achieving superior performance on complex structural reasoning tasks compared to static models?
*   **Validated Components:**
    *   `ARC-GENOME-v3`: The GATformer (Graph Attention Transformer) as the core reasoning engine.
    *   `ARC-REGULATION`: The Epigenetic Control Module (ECM) and its library of Computational Transcription Factors (CTFs).
    *   `Dual-Stream Cognitive Architecture`: The ARC-SPLICER V2 mechanism for separating semantic and pragmatic information streams.
*   **Primary Experiments:**
    *   Rigorous ablation studies isolating the performance contribution of the ECM and dynamic graph topology, framed as tests of the System 2 engine's adaptability.
    *   Comparative benchmarking against state-of-the-art GNNs and Transformers on graph-structured datasets (e.g., OGB, LRGB) and custom-built benchmarks for legal/financial document analysis.
    *   Analysis of the "Onco-Loop" and "Epigenetic Drift" failure modes as defined in `ARC-Genome Validation Experimental Framework_.md`.
*   **Associated Repository:** `chimera-genome-core` (PyTorch implementation of the GATformer and ECM).

### **Paper 2: The Perceptual Foundation**

*   **Proposed Title:** *Object-Centric Conceptual Encoding: Learning a Disentangled "Genome" for Multimodal Perception*
*   **Core Research Question:** Can a hierarchical, object-centric VQ-VAE, trained on a multi-modal curriculum, learn a compositional and disentangled "vocabulary" of concepts that serves as a robust foundation for downstream reasoning tasks?
*   **Validated Components:**
    *   `ARC-PERCEPTION`: The full Object-Centric Conceptual Encoder (OCCE) module.
    *   `Chimera-1 Generative Concept Architecture_.md`: The principles of semantic vector quantization and hierarchical concept formation.
    *   `Agentic Context Engineering Blueprint_.md`: The "Context Engineer" node, which acts as the "System 1" intuitive engine, providing the initial perceptual context for the reasoning core.
*   **Primary Experiments:**
    *   Quantitative evaluation of reconstruction fidelity and, critically, disentanglement metrics (e.g., MIG, SAP, DCI scores).
    *   Qualitative analysis of the learned conceptual codebook's interpretability.
    *   Downstream task evaluation to measure the utility of the learned representations for planning and control.
*   **Associated Repository:** `chimera-perception` (Implementation of the OCCE and associated training/evaluation scripts).

### **Paper 3: The Psychological Control System**

*   **Proposed Title:** *A Computational Model of the Multi-Part Mind: Implementing Internal Family Systems for Agentic Cognitive Control*
*   **Core Research Question:** Can the Internal Family Systems (IFS) model of human psychology be operationalized as a robust cognitive control architecture for an autonomous agent, enabling a stable balance between proactive planning ("Managers") and reactive self-protection ("Firefighters")?
*   **Validated Components:**
    *   `ARC-CONTROL`: The complete action and control system, including the HTN Planner and the Firefighter reactive policies.
    *   `Chimera-1 Intrinsic Alignment Blueprint_.md`: The Affective Core as the primary trigger for Firefighter activation.
    *   `Genomic Mind's Psychological Blueprint_.md`: The "System of Selves" and the "8 C's" of Self-leadership as a formal objective function.
*   **Primary Experiments:**
    *   Deployment in the "Crucible" environment to test the agent's response to ethically-charged stimuli and validate the "Emergent Discomfort" benchmark.
    *   Quantitative measurement of the agent's ability to maintain homeostatic balance (as defined by the "8 C's" KPIs) under cognitive and affective stress.
    *   Ablation studies disabling specific "parts" (e.g., Firefighters) to demonstrate their causal role in the agent's behavior.
*   **Associated Repository:** `chimera-control-systems` (Implementation of the HTN planner, Firefighter policies, and the FSM-based Self-MetaController).

### **Paper 4: The Evolutionary Lifecycle**

*   **Proposed Title:** *Emergent Co-evolution: Validating Interaction-Driven Skill Transfer in a Multi-Agent Ecosystem*
*   **Core Research Question:** Can a population of agents, each undergoing an independent "Phoenix Cycle" of learning, achieve emergent co-evolution and skill transfer simply by interacting in a shared environment and incorporating each other's behaviors into their respective training data?
*   **Validated Components:**
    *   `Chimera-1 Learning Lifecycle Blueprint_.md`: The "Phoenix Cycle" for individual agent learning.
    *   The **"Crucible"** (`Chimera-1 Agentic Benchmark Design_.md`) as the shared evolutionary ecosystem.
    *   The **data pipeline** that feeds `ActionTranscript` data from one agent's "Wake" phase into the experience replay buffer of its interaction partners for their "Sleep" phase.
*   **Primary Experiments:**
    *   A longitudinal study of two specialized agents (e.g., "Lawyer" and "Coder") collaborating in the Crucible, measuring skill transfer and the emergence of hybrid capabilities over time.
    *   An ablation study disabling the cross-agent data sharing pipeline to quantify its causal impact on co-evolution. The control group will consist of agents that interact but do not train on each other's experiences.
    *   Analysis of the agents' LoRA-based "Selves" to identify structural changes corresponding to learned "traits" from their interaction partners.
*   **Associated Repository:** `chimera-crucible` (Implementation of the multi-agent Crucible environment and the interaction-driven data sharing pipeline).

### **Paper 5: The Alignment & Governance Framework**

*   **Proposed Title:** *Constitutional AI over Conceptual Codes: A Framework for Provably Aligned Agents*
*   **Core Research Question:** Can the principles of Constitutional AI, applied to a pre-linguistic conceptual space, effectively govern the interaction between a fast, intuitive "System 1" (`Context_Engineer`) and a slow, deliberative "System 2" (`Planner`), leading to robustly aligned behavior?
*   **Validated Components:**
    *   `Chimera-1 Alignment and Safety Blueprint_.md`: The ORPO-CAI synthesis for monolithic alignment.
    *   `Chimera-1_ Ethical Safety Requirements_.md`: The Chimera Constitution and the Safety Requirement Specification (SRS) framework.
*   **Primary Experiments:**
    *   Comparative analysis of an agent aligned via ORPO-CAI on its conceptual plans versus a baseline aligned on natural language preferences.
    *   Extensive red-teaming to test the robustness of the conceptual alignment against adversarial attacks and "jailbreaking" attempts that exploit linguistic ambiguity.
    *   Demonstration of the full governance lifecycle, from a new safety requirement to its implementation and verification via the Unified Traceability Matrix.
*   **Associated Repository:** `chimera-alignment-suite` (The implementation of the ORPO-CAI loss function, the Constitutional Interpreter, and the "Crucible" testbed for safety evaluation).

This roadmap provides a clear, structured, and ambitious program of research. By pursuing these five lines of inquiry, the Chimera-1 project will not only produce a state-of-the-art agentic AI but will also contribute fundamental, peer-reviewed knowledge to the broader scientific community.
